# Social Binaries

## Description
Social Binaries expands the use of the widely adopted health code system into several more cultural values. The project deconstructs the information asymmetry between a user and the designer of an opaque system such as the health QR code. Users can scan the QR code and receive a rating on beauty, kindness, dedication, filial piety and integrity. By subjecting these values to computational evaluation, Social Binaries highlights the increasing influence of algorithmic control in everyday life.
